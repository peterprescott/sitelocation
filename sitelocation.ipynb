    "The company you've been dealing with want to experiment with several factors that they think are important in the location process. They want an application that combines maps of the UK that represent the things that are important to them. Each map has a shading intensity which represents the best areas on the basis of different factors. For example, on the population map the areas near near city centres will be lighter than other areas. The maps need weights attributing to them depending on GUI scrollbars that the company execs can play with. They like that kind of thing.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Makes a display that combines/merges the maps, with the weighting on each map determined by one of three scrollbars, and displays them combined. I.e. if you turn up the scrollbars for geology and population and turn down the one for transport, the first two maps will be merged and the shading on the map will be 50 percent due to each. For a badly coded example see [here](http://www.ccg.leeds.ac.uk/teaching/nuclearwaste/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, take the three values for each pixel (one value from the geology, one from the population, one from the transport), and multiple each by the scrollbar value for that map. Then add the values from the three maps together. Repeat this for all the pixels, and then re-range the dataset so that the numbers come out in the 0 to 255 range. Use this dataset to then construct a **grayscale** image.\n",
